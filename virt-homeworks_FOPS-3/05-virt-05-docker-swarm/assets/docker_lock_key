[centos@node01 ~]$ sudo docker swarm update --autolock=true
Swarm updated.
To unlock a swarm manager after it restarts, run the `docker swarm unlock`
command and provide the following key:

    SWMKEY-1-0GnC203wEApIFq0cqXQYC2Y4czObljhJaawawtGSwzw

Please remember to store this key in a password manager, since without it you
will not be able to restart the manager.
